            Despite the widespread use of avatars, it is unknown which Internet forums were the first to use them; the
            earliest forums did not include avatars as a default feature, and they were included in unofficial "hacks"
            before eventually being made standard. Avatars on Internet forums serve the purpose of representing users
            and their actions, personalizing their contributions to the forum, and may represent different parts of
            their persona, beliefs, interests or social status in the forum.

            The traditional avatar system used on most Internet forums is a small (80x80 to 100x100 pixels, for example)
            square-shaped area close to the user's forum post, where the avatar is placed in order for other users to
            easily identify who has written the post without having to read their username. Some forums allow the user
            to upload an avatar image that may have been designed by the user or acquired from elsewhere. Other forums
            allow the user to select an avatar from a preset list or use an auto-discovery algorithm to extract one from
            the user's homepage.

            Some avatars are animated, consisting of a sequence of multiple images played repeatedly. In such animated
            avatars, the number of images as well as the time in which they are replayed vary considerably.

            Other avatar systems exist, such as on Gaia Online, WeeWorld, Frenzoo or Meez, where a pixelized
            representation of a person or creature is used, which can then be customized to the user's wishes. There are
            also avatar systems (e.g. Trutoon) where a representation is created using a person's face with customized
            characters and backgrounds.

            Another avatar-based system is one wherein an image is automatically generated based on the identity of the
            poster. Identicons are formed as visually distinct geometric images derived from a digest hash of the
            poster's IP address. In this way, a particular anonymous user can be uniquely identified from session to
            session without the need for registration or authentication. In the cases where registration has occurred,
            the identicon serves as a means to associate a particular user with a particular geometric representation.
            If an account is compromised, a dissimilar identicon will be formed as the attacker is posting from an
            unfamiliar IP address.

            Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi), he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja; regularly looked to
            for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi
            teaches the importance of teamwork, a lesson he received, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood
            friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage (六代目火影,
            Rokudaime Hokage, Literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).

                Kali Linux (Kali) is a Linux distribution system that was developed with a focus on penetration testing.
                Previously, Kali Linux was distributed as BackTrack, which itself is a merger between three different
                live Linux penetration testing distributions: IWHAX, WHOPPIX, and Auditor.

                BackTrack is one of the most famous Linux distribution systems, as can be proven by the number of
                downloads, which reached more than four million as of BackTrack Linux 4.0 pre final.

                Kali Linux Version 1.0 was released on March 12, 2013. Five days later, Version 1.0.1 was released,
                which fixed the USB keyboard issue. In those five days, Kali had been downloaded more than 90,000 times.

                An updated version, Kali Linux 2.0, was released on August 11, 2015. This distribution aimed to provide
                a better end-user experience, while still maintaining the full functionality of the previous versions.
                One of the major improvements available in Kali Linux 2.0 was moving toward a rolling distribution. This
                meant that the Kali Linux developers were pulling updated base Linux packages directly as they were
                updated, giving the user a stable platform that is updated regularly.
