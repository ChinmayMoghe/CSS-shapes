            The traditional avatar system used on most Internet forums is a small (80x80 to 100x100 pixels, for example)
            square-shaped area close to the user's forum post, where the avatar is placed in order for other users to
            easily identify who has written the post without having to read their username. Some forums allow the user
            to upload an avatar image that may have been designed by the user or acquired from elsewhere. Other forums
            allow the user to select an avatar from a preset list or use an auto-discovery algorithm to extract one from
            the user's homepage.

            Some avatars are animated, consisting of a sequence of multiple images played repeatedly. In such animated
            avatars, the number of images as well as the time in which they are replayed vary considerably.

            Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of the
            Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi), he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja; regularly looked to
            for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi
            teaches the importance of teamwork, a lesson he received, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood
            friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage (六代目火影,
            Rokudaime Hokage, Literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).

                Kali Linux (Kali) is a Linux distribution system that was developed with a focus on penetration testing.
                Previously, Kali Linux was distributed as BackTrack, which itself is a merger between three different
                live Linux penetration testing distributions: IWHAX, WHOPPIX, and Auditor.

                BackTrack is one of the most famous Linux distribution systems, as can be proven by the number of
                downloads, which reached more than four million as of BackTrack Linux 4.0 pre final.

                Kali Linux Version 1.0 was released on March 12, 2013. Five days later, Version 1.0.1 was released,
                which fixed the USB keyboard issue. In those five days, Kali had been downloaded more than 90,000 times.
